Utilizing Natural Language Processing for Financial News Sentiment Analysis and Stock Market Prediction

1. Introduction
This repository contains code for three different models:

i. Random Classifier: A simple model that predicts sentiment based on provided text data.
ii. Simple Neural Network: A basic neural network trained on text data to predict sentiment.
iii. LSTM Model for Stock Prediction: An LSTM model trained on news headlines to predict stock market movements.


2. Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
i. Python (version 3.x)
ii. Required Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, torch, nltk, matplotlib, transformers, ipywidgets

pip install pandas scikit-learn torch nltk matplotlib transformers ipywidgets

4. Instructions
a. Random Classifier
	Make sure you have the following files in your directory:
	Data.csv: Dataset containing sentiment-labeled text.
	Execute the provided Python script random_classifier.py.
	Follow the instructions and execute the code block by block.
b. Simple Neural Network
	Ensure you have the following files in your directory:
	Data.csv: Dataset containing sentiment-labeled text.
	Run the provided Python script simple_neural_network.py.
	Follow the instructions and execute the code block by block.
c. LSTM Model for Stock Prediction
	Make sure you have the following files in your directory:
	Combined_News_DJIA.csv: Dataset containing news headlines and stock market labels.
	Run the provided Python script lstm_stock_prediction.py.
	Follow the instructions and execute the code block by block.

	Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you can execute each model and observe their performance in sentiment analysis and stock prediction for Financial News tasks.
